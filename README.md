# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
![Sorting Visualizer](https://i.ibb.co/tpt2bhn/1.jpg)

This visualizer is developed for simulation of various sorting algorithms such as QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort for better understanding and comparison among them.


Algorithms covererd in this project are :
|     Name        | Function Name   |
| -------------   | -------------   |
| Selection Sort  |  selection_sort |
| Insertion Sort  |  insertion_sort |
| Merge Sort      |  merge_sort     |
| Quick Sort      |  quick_sort     |
| Bubble Sort     |  bubble_sort    |
| Heap Sort       |  heap_sort      |

# How to run:

Install

```pip install -r requirements.txt``` 

Run

```python main.py function_name```

Pass function name as a command line argument from list of functions above
(in all lower case and spaces replaced by underscore).

**For example:** 

```python main.py quick_sort```
